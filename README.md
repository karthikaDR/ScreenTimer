# ScreenTimer

This application is to keep track of children screen time activities. So, screen timer keeps log of how long a child watches screen per day and also allows the parents to have control over the screen time limitation. We designed an ipad application using the Figma tool and layed out the UX design that is customer-centric, user-friendly and reachable to parents of all ages.
